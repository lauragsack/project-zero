https://lauragsack.github.io/project-zero/

As someone who likes dogs, you may want to test your dog knowledge and get even more knowledgable! Here's how to play:

* The game objective is to select the breed name that corresponds to the dog in the photo.
* Click the "Start Game" button to play.
* The game randomly selects a dog photo to play and displays it on the gameboard.
* The game randomly selects possible breed name answers and displays them on the gameboard.
* Click the correct breed name.
* After selecting a breed name, the game will determine if you answered correctly.
* If you answered correctly, you score 100 points. 
* This sequence repeats for four more rounds.
* The game ends after round five, and reports which breeds you answered correctly.
* You can play the game again by clicking the "Play again" button.
